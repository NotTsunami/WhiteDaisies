# WhiteDaisies
Are you tired of getting Lepton Daisies from boss fights or in the bazaar? Me too! I believe Tier 1 (White) better suits the effectiveness of this item.

## Features
This changes the rarity of Lepton Daisies to Tier 1 (White). The sprite in the HUD still contains a green outline, as this is the way the sprite is provided, however Lepton Daisies are still considered a Tier 1 item with this mod.

## Installation
1. Install [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/) and [R2API](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/).
2. Copy the included `WhiteDaisies.dll` into the resulting `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins` folder.
3. Launch the game and enjoy! To remove you simply need to delete the `WhiteDaisies.dll` file.

## Changelog
### Version 1.0.1
- Small code cleanup (Mostly aesthetic)
